# Sustaining engineering and project maintenance

_Work with the PRoot / Care code base and squash bugs, write new documentation, and polish CI/CD pipelines to prepare for a new release_

## Description

The last release of PRoot / Care is from 2014. Since then, there have been over fifty bug reports that have been left unresolved. Likewise, documentation is rather sparse, making the code difficult to learn for newer contributors.

## Outcomes

The goal of this project is to take a crack at cutting down some of these open bug reports, and documenting the code so that things are easier to find.

## Requirements

c, git, linux, ptrace, syscalls

## Mentor(s)

Lucas Ramage

## Difficulty

Easy
